The majority of the used images are from google, deviantart and other pages with free images and artwork.
The idea was born as an inspiration from http://marvel.com/, where some of the pictures I used for headers were inspired from and then created in Photohop.
The gallery art is either inspired from http://wowslider.com/, http://www.flash-gallery.com/, http://codepen.io/ or http://tympanus.net/codrops/.
The main artistic animations and java scripts are either used from http://tympanus.net/codrops/ or inspired from there.
Some backgrounds, icons and fonts are from http://www.strip.tsp.edu.rs/.
